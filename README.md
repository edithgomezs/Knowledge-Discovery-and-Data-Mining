# Knowledge-Discovery-and-Data-Mining: Flight Delay Prediction

Our goal for this project is to accurately predict if a flight will be delayed based on the data provided by the
airports and weather reports in the area. Our analysis uses historical data of domestic flights [4] in the U.S.
along with the weather report for the departure date, departure location, arrival date, and arrival location [5].
By creating a model that can accurately predict if a flight is delayed, airlines can notify customers beforehand
to prevent frustration and loss of profit. In addition to training an accurate model, some other questions
airlines would be interested in having answers for are “Which airport locations are more prone to suffer flight
delays?”, “Does the weather variables of a location affect the schedule of flights?”, and “How much distance
on average is covered on different days throughout the year?”. These questions will drive decisions from
airlines to optimize flight schedules and customer satisfaction
